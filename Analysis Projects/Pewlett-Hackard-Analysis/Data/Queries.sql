-- Challenge Deliverables
-- Delivering Results: A README.md in the form of a technical report that details your analysis and findings
-- Technical Analysis Deliverable 1: Number of Retiring Employees by Title. You will create three new tables, one showing number of [titles] retiring, one showing number of employees with each title, and one showing a list of current employees born between Jan. 1, 1952 and Dec. 31, 1955. New tables are exported as CSVs.
-- Technical Analysis Deliverable 2: Mentorship Eligibility. A table containing employees who are eligible for the mentorship program (and the CSV containing the data)
